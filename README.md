****2. Mark :**** The code demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, constructors, instance variables, methods, and method overloading in Java.</br>
      The provided code defines two classes, **Marksheet** and **Mark**. </br> The **Marksheet** class represents a student's marks and details, and the **Mark** class contains the **main** method to create instances of the **Marksheet** class and demonstrate its usage.</br></br></br>

In this example, we have three classes: **SuperClassAnimal**, **DerivedClassDog**, and **Cat**.
